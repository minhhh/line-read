# line-read [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/minhhh/line-read.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/minhhh/line-read)

Read line by line from a stream, file or stdin lazily.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save line-read
```


## Usage
Read all lines from a small file in one go

```js
    var readline = require('line-read');
    readline.readLineFromFile('filename').join(function(xs) {
        // xs is the list of lines from the file
    });
```

To read from a very large file, it would be better to read each line one by one.

```js
    var readline = require('line-read');
    readline.readLineFromFile('filename').forEach(function(line) {
        console.log(line);
    });
```

Reading from stdin is similar to reading from a large file

```js
    var readline = require('line-read');
    readline.readLine(process.stdin).forEach(function(line) {
        console.log('line ' + line);
    });
```


## API

All methods return a `lazy` instance of lines. See the [lazy](https://github.com/pkrumins/node-lazy) package for more details.

### readLine(stream, separator)

Get lines from stream. Lines are separated by separator, default to `\n`.

### readLineFromFile(filename, separator)

Get lines from file `filename`. Lines are separated by separator, default to `\n`.
